## Description
As F1 Formula fans, there is a need to view F1 Formula news, teams, and races at a simpler design. For that reason, we designed and developed a simple application that allows users to keep track of the news, teams, and events related to the F1 Formula race. The front-end of the application was developed in HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The back-end of the application was developed in JavaScript. We used two different APIs to gather the information of the F1 Formula. The first API that we used was [api-sports](https://api-sports.io/documentation/formula-1/v1). The second API that we used was [newscatcher-api](https://rapidapi.com/newscatcher-api-newscatcher-api-default/api/free-news/).
